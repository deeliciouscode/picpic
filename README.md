2. Open a browser and type:
    localhost:5000
  
3. You can now add insta Tags. just type them in the field 
    in the left upper corner and add enter after each tag

    just submit them. It now takes a while and it will down-
    load the images in the background. I will add loading
    indicators later.

    is ready you will be prompted to select a download folder.
